					I have started the following steps from 2023 until now to increase my daily, weekly, and monthly savings.

					<B>STEP 01</B><BR><BR>
					My mother had a fixed deposit at Indian Bank for 10 years.
					The principal amount was <B>400,000.00 &#8377;</B>, and she used to receive <B>2,147.00 &#8377;</B> each month as interest.<BR><BR>
					On <B>10-Dec-2025 (IST)</B>, I went to Indian Bank and closed this fixed deposit.<BR><BR>
					<B>Reasons for closing:</B><BR>
					1) She received interest every month on the 10th.<BR>
					2) The deposit renewal date each year was 10-Dec.<BR><BR>
					After closing the FD:<BR>
					– I transferred the entire 400,000.00 &#8377; from her Indian Bank account to my SBI account using NEFT.<BR>
					– Then from my SBI account, I transferred 400,000.00 &#8377; to my mother’s Post Office account using NEFT.<BR><BR>
					On <B>Fri, 12-Dec-2025</B>, I opened a <B>Monthly Income Scheme (MIS)</B> in my mother’s Post Office account through internet banking.<BR><BR>
					She will receive:<BR>
					– 2,473.00 &#8377; for 10 months<BR>
					– 2,472.00 &#8377; for 2 months<BR><BR>
					From <B>Jan-2026</B>, I will provide <B>2,300.00 &#8377;</B> to my mother every month (on the 12th) for her expenses.<BR>
					The remaining amount (<B>2472 − 2300 = 172.00 &#8377;</B>) will be saved in her Post Office account for <B>26 months</B> (2 years 6 months).<BR><BR>
					<B>Expected Savings After 26 Months:</B>
					<TABLE class="td-black-text" border="1">

					After 2.5 years, I will open a new MIS using this saved interest amount.

					<B>STEP 02</B><BR><BR>
					I need to pay my son’s school fees of <B>55,000.00 &#8377;</B> on <B>Sat, 10-Jan-2026</B>.<BR><BR>
					To prepare, I opened a fixed deposit of <B>27,968.00 &#8377;</B> at SBI on <B>10-Dec-2025</B>.<BR>
					This FD will close on <B>10-Jan-2026</B>.<BR><BR>
					For every fixed deposit at SBI, I always submit <B>Form 15G</B> for income tax purposes.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<TD>
					<B>STEP 03</B><BR><BR>
					Whenever my mother’s Post Office account savings reach <B>1,000.00 &#8377;</B>,
					I transfer it to my SBI account and open a <B>46-day fixed deposit</B>.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<TD>
					<B>STEP 04</B><BR><BR>
					I have started saving money in my joint Post Office account for my son’s school fees.<BR>
					Whenever the savings reach <B>1,000.00 &#8377;</B>, I open a fixed deposit at SBI for <B>46 days or 7 days</B>, depending on the school fee due date.<BR><BR>
					Although I open multiple fixed deposits, I always ensure each FD has a **different closing date**.<BR>
					<B>Reason:</B> To avoid service charges.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<TD>
					<B>STEP 05</B><BR><BR>
					Whenever I save <B>5,000.00 &#8377;</B>, I open an MIS at the Post Office on any day of the month:<BR>
					01–AnyMonth–AnyYear<BR>
					02–AnyMonth–AnyYear<BR>
					...<BR>
					31–AnyMonth–AnyYear<BR><BR>
					<B>Reason:</B><BR>
					By opening MIS accounts on different dates, I receive MIS interest on different days,
					which helps me manage my daily spending.
