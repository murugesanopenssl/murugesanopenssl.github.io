				<H2>1. My Question to ChatGPT</h2>
				<P><STRONG>Date/Time:</STRONG> Fri 09-Jan-2026 09:33 AM IST</P>
				<P>
					Today fixed deposit closing: 28,016.00 (principal)₹, total 28,032.00 (interest 16.00 ₹).  
					Tue 13-Jan-2026 IST: principal 1,042.00 ₹, total 1,045.00 (interest 3.00 ₹).  
				I need to pay BSNL 1,020.00 ₹ on or before 19-Jan-2026.  
				</P>
				<P>
				I am planning to pay the BSNL amount on 13-Jan-2026 from the closing fixed deposit of 1,045.00 ₹.  
				I can also take 1,020.00 ₹ from 28,032.00 ₹ and keep 27,012.00 ₹ as principal to open fixed deposits till 31-Jan-2026 for 7-day terms.  
				Which is better for earning more interest?
				</P>
				<UL>
				<LI>Option 1: Take 1,020.00 ₹ from today’s closed principal, re-open 27,012.00 ₹ as fixed deposit, and also use 1,045.00 ₹ as principal on 13-Jan-2026 repeatedly till 31-Jan-2026 for 7-day terms.</LI>
				<LI>Option 2: Take 1,045.00 ₹ on 13-Jan-2026 and pay BSNL the same day.</LI>
				</UL>

				<h2>2. Initial Response from ChatGPT</h2>
				<P>
				The initial analysis suggested paying the bill later would be better, based on the general principle that keeping a larger principal invested for a longer period usually earns more interest.
				</P>
				<P>
				<STRONG>Limitation:</STRONG> This did not account for SBI’s rounding-to-the-nearest-rupee method applied to short-term fixed deposits.

				<h2>3. Knowledge Transfer to ChatGPT</h2>
				<FONT color='black'>
				<P><STRONG>Date/Time:</STRONG> Fri 09-Jan-2026 09:45 AM IST</P>
				<P>SBI interest calculation rule clarified with real values:</P>
				<PRE>SBI ETDR INTEREST = ROUND(PRINCIPAL × 3.05 × 7 / 36500 , 0)</PRE>
				<UL>
				<LI>Interest rate: <STRONG>3.05% per annum</STRONG></LI>
				<LI>Tenure: <STRONG>7 days</STRONG></LI>
				<LI>Interest rounded to the <STRONG>nearest rupee</STRONG></LI>
				</UL>
				<P>Key insights transferred:</P>
				<UL>
				<LI>SBI rounding causes interest to be earned in discrete steps</LI>
				<LI>Splitting deposits can increase total interest</LI>
				<LI>Early payment can sometimes improve overall returns</LI>
				</UL>
				<div class="note">
				This knowledge corrected the earlier assumption and led to the conclusion that paying the bill earlier and splitting deposits earned more interest.
