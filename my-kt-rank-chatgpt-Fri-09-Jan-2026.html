  <h2>1. My Question to ChatGPT</h2>
  <p><strong>Date/Time:</strong> Fri 09-Jan-2026 09:33 AM IST</p>
  <p>
    Today fixed deposit closing: ₹28,016.00 (principal), total ₹28,032.00 (interest ₹16.00).  
    13-Jan-2026: principal ₹1,042.00, total ₹1,045.00 (interest ₹3).  
    I need to pay BSNL ₹1,020.00 on or before 19-Jan-2026.  
  </p>
  <p>
    I am planning to pay the BSNL amount on 13-Jan-2026 from the closing fixed deposit of ₹1,045.00.  
    I can also take ₹1,020.00 from ₹28,032.00 and keep ₹27,012.00 as principal to open fixed deposits till 31-Jan-2026 for 7-day terms.  
    Which is better for earning more interest?
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Option 1: Take ₹1,020 from today’s closed principal, re-open ₹27,012 as fixed deposit, and also use ₹1,045 as principal on 13-Jan-2026 repeatedly till 31-Jan-2026 for 7-day terms.</li>
    <li>Option 2: Take ₹1,045 on 13-Jan-2026 and pay BSNL the same day.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Initial Response from ChatGPT</h2>
  <p>
    The initial analysis suggested paying the bill later would be better, based on the general principle that keeping a larger principal invested for a longer period usually earns more interest.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Limitation:</strong> This did not account for SBI’s rounding-to-the-nearest-rupee method applied to short-term fixed deposits.

  <h2>3. Knowledge Transfer to ChatGPT</h2>
  <p><strong>Date/Time:</strong> Fri 09-Jan-2026 09:45 AM IST</p>
  <p>SBI interest calculation rule clarified with real values:</p>
  <pre>SBI ETDR INTEREST = ROUND(PRINCIPAL × 3.05 × 7 / 36500 , 0)</pre>
  <ul>
    <li>Interest rate: <strong>3.05% per annum</strong></li>
    <li>Tenure: <strong>7 days</strong></li>
    <li>Interest rounded to the <strong>nearest rupee</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Key insights transferred:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SBI rounding causes interest to be earned in discrete steps</li>
    <li>Splitting deposits can increase total interest</li>
    <li>Early payment can sometimes improve overall returns</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="note">
    This knowledge corrected the earlier assumption and led to the conclusion that paying the bill earlier and splitting deposits earned more interest.
