				<H2>1. My Question to ChatGPT</h2>
				<FONT color='black'>
					<P><STRONG>Date/Time:</STRONG> Fri 09-Jan-2026 09:33 AM IST</P>
					<P>
						Today fixed deposit closing: 28,016.00 (principal)ரூ/₹/INR, total 28,032.00 (interest 16.00 ரூ/₹/INR). <BR>
						On Tue 13-Jan-2026 IST: I am receiving ETDR principal of 1,042.00 ரூ/₹/INR, and total amount of 1,045.00 (principal 1,042.00 ரூ/₹/INR + interest 3.00 ரூ/₹/INR).<BR>
					I need to pay BSNL 1,020.00 ரூ/₹/INR on or before Mon 19-Jan-2026 IST.
					</P>
					<P>
					I am planning to pay the BSNL amount on Tue 13-Jan-2026 IST from the closing fixed deposit of 1,045.00 ரூ/₹/INR.<BR>
					Today, I can take 1,020.00 ரூ/₹/INR from today's ETDR amount 28,032.00 ரூ/₹/INR and keep 27,012.00 ரூ/₹/INR as principal to open new fixed deposit again for 7 day ETDR till end of this month 31-Jan-2026 using 7-day terms.<BR>
					Which is better to earn more ETDR interest?<BR>
					</P>
				<UL>
				<LI>Option 1: Take 1,020.00 ரூ/₹/INR from today’s closed principal, re-open 27,012.00 ரூ/₹/INR as fixed deposit, and also use 1,045.00 ரூ/₹/INR as principal on Tue 13-Jan-2026 IST repeatedly till 31-Jan-2026 for 7-day terms.</LI>
				<LI>Option 2: Take 1,045.00 ரூ/₹/INR on Tue 13-Jan-2026 IST and pay BSNL on Tue 13-Jan-2026 IST.</LI>

				<h2>2. Initial Response from ChatGPT</h2>
				<FONT color='black'>
				<P>
				The initial analysis suggested paying the bill later would be better, based on the general principle that keeping a larger principal invested for a longer period usually earns more interest.<BR>
				Hence pay on Tue 13-Jan-2026 IST.
				</P>
				<P>
				<STRONG>Limitation:</STRONG> This did not account for SBI’s rounding-to-the-nearest-rupee method applied to short-term fixed deposits.

				<FONT color='black'>
				<P><STRONG>Date/Time:</STRONG> Fri 09-Jan-2026 09:45 AM IST</P>
				<P>SBI interest calculation rule clarified with real values:</P>
				<PRE>SBI ETDR INTEREST = ROUND(PRINCIPAL × 3.05 × 7 / 36500 , 0)</PRE>
				If interest having greater than or equal to 0.50 round that to 1.00 ரூ/₹/INR<BR>
				If interest having less than 0.50 round that to 0.00 ரூ/₹/INR<BR>
				<UL>
				<LI>Interest rate: <STRONG>3.05% per annum</STRONG></LI>
				<LI>Tenure: <STRONG>7 days</STRONG></LI>
				<LI>Interest rounded to the <STRONG>nearest rupee</STRONG></LI>
				</UL>
				<P>Key insights transferred:</P>
				<UL>
				<LI>SBI rounding causes interest to be earned in discrete steps</LI>
				<LI>Splitting deposits can increase total interest</LI>
				<LI>Early payment can sometimes improve overall returns</LI>
				</UL>
				<div class="note">
				This knowledge corrected the earlier assumption and led to the conclusion that paying the bill earlier and splitting deposits earned more interest.
