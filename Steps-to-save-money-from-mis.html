			Steps to save money using the interest received from a MIS account at the Indian Post Office.

		<P>
			After five years, I re-open each MIS by re-depositing the same amount with a small increase or decrease based on interest earned.

					To buy medicines from Apollo Pharmacy.<BR>
					I am following these steps from Feb-2006 till now if buying medicines.<BR>
					1) If I buy tablets at Apollo Pharmacy, medical bills are available online to submit during income tax return.<BR>
					2) Apollo Pharmacy provides some tips (1.00 or 2.00 or 3.00 INR, etc.) based on the tablets we buy. We can use this amount for deduction if we buy medicines from Apollo Pharmacy.<BR>
					Example reason for deduction:<BR>
					Assume the amount is 12.23 INR.<BR>
					I can pay 10.00 INR from my packet and 2.23 INR from the tip amount at Apollo Pharmacy.<BR>
					If the amount to pay is 199.99 INR, I pay 190.00 INR from my packet and 9.99 INR from Apollo Pharmacy tip amount.<BR>
					If the amount is 202.99 INR, I pay 200.00 INR from SBI debit card (SBI reward points) and 2.99 INR from Apollo Pharmacy tip amount. Due to this 202.99 INR amount, I will get some points at Apollo Pharmacy.
