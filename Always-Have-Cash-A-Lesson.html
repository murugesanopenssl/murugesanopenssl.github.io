						My mother traveled from the school to the bus stand using auto, then from the bus stand to my house.
					</P>
					<P>
						On <B>Sun 01-Feb-2026</B> (IST), she stepped down from the auto and needed to pay the auto driver (Kannada, Karnataka, India).
					</P>
					<P>
						She was unable to pay using GPay.
					</P>
					<P>
						The reason: State Bank of India services were scheduled to be down on <B>Sun 01-Feb-2026</B> from <B>06:45 AM to 07:30 AM IST</B>.

					<P>
						Even I was unable to transfer the money to that auto driver.
