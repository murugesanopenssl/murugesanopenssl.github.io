					<H1>Self-Insurance Plan for My Parents/wife/son and myself</H1>
					<P>

								<U>
									I DO NOT WANT TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE FROM ANY PRIVATE AND FROM ANY GOVERNMENT PROVIDERS.</P>
								</B>

					<P>I am following my own strategy to secure funds for emergencies using Post Office schemes like MIS and NSC.</P>
					<P>Example: My recent experience demonstrates how this works in practice.</P>
					<P>A loan insurance was applied by my family mate on Fri 14-Nov-2025 IST, but I did not know about it until Mon 26-Jan-2026 IST.<BR>
					On Tue 27-Jan-2026 IST, I came to know the insurance and immediately pre-closed 46 MIS accounts from my post office account.<BR>
					EACH OF THOSE MIS PRINCIPAL WAS 3,000.00 ರೂ/ரூ/₹ INR each.<BR>
					DEDUCTION AT EACH MIS DUE TO PRE-CLOSURE: 62.00 INR<BR>
					Total received amount:<BR>
					(46 * 3000.00) - ( 46 * 62.00 )  = 138,000.00 - 2,852.00 = 135148.00 INR<BR>
					a) 1,09,521.00 ರೂ/ரூ/₹ INR for gold loan.<BR>
					b) 10,500.00 ರೂ/ரூ/₹ INR for my son's school fees during 01-Mar-2026 IST<BR>
					c) 10,000.00 ರೂ/ரூ/₹ INR for my 2 wheeler repair during Wed 18-Feb-2026 IST.<BR>
					d)  5,127.00 ರೂ/ரூ/₹ INR SBI ETDR for my son's school fees during Jun-2026 IST for 11th standard school fees.<BR>
					</P>
					<P>On Tue 27-Jan-2026 IST, I paid 7,000.00 + 1,566.00 + 950.00 + 6,005.00 ರೂ/ரூ/₹ INR<BR>
					On Wed 28-Jan-2026 IST, I paid 94,000.00 ರೂ/ரூ/₹ INR to close my loan.<BR>
					Total gold loan amount paid by me was 1,09,521.00 ರೂ/ரூ/₹ INR</P>
					<P>The gold loan itself ended on Wed 28-Jan-2026 IST, so the self-insurance corpus ensured that all obligations were met immediately without delay.</P>
					<P>My rules for this strategy:</P>
					<TABLE border='1'>
						<TR>
							<TD>1</TD>
							<TD>Maintain disciplined weekly/monthly deposits in NSC and MIS to grow corpus</TD>
						</TR>
						<TR>
							<TD>2</TD>
							<TD>Stagger NSC maturities to ensure liquidity when needed</TD>
						</TR>
						<TR>
							<TD>3</TD>
							<TD>Use MIS interest as steady income (salary equivalent)</TD>
						</TR>
						<TR>
							<TD>4</TD>
							<TD>Pre-close deposits if urgent funds required for medical, school fees, or other emergencies</TD>
						</TR>
						<TR>
							<TD>5</TD>
							<TD>Reinvest matured funds into NSC or MIS to continue compounding</TD>
						</TR>
					</TABLE>
					<P class='highlight'>This approach allows me to self-insure my parents without relying on insurers, avoiding premiums, exclusions, and claim rejections.</P>
					<P>By following this method, I ensure:</P>
					<UL>
						<LI>Guaranteed returns from government-backed schemes</LI>
						<LI>Control over withdrawals and timing</LI>
						<LI>Emergency funds ready when needed</LI>
						<LI>Ability to redeploy funds for indirect income or new investments</LI>
					</UL>
					<P>This is my personal way of creating a secure financial plan for my parents using disciplined savings and strategic fund management.</P>
