		<H1>New Employee Savings Guide</H1>
			<P>This guide explains how new employees at private companies can manage their salary and savings effectively.</P>
			<H2>1. Open a Salary Account</H2>
			<UL>
				<LI>Open a salary account at <STRONG>SBI (State Bank of India)</STRONG>.</LI>
				<LI>Reason: SBI is a government bank and provides reliable Internet banking, <EM>YONO Lite</EM> and <EM>YONO SBI</EM> mobile apps.</LI>
				<LI>We will manage money using banking apps, not by visiting the bank physically.</LI>
				<LI><FONT color='red'>
				Exception I have seen at a private bank during 2016 IST:<BR>
				I went to the private bank at Dharmapuri/Tamilnadu/India during 2016 IST<BR>
				Submitted a letter to the private bank manager to close my account.<BR>
				Manager told me to give the letter to a near by person.<BR>
				Before given my letter I have taken snapshot using my mobile.<BR>
				After 3/4 weeks I have received an email informing me to pay 15000.00 INR to that private bank,<BR>
				since I have not handled minimum balane at my private bank account from noreply@thatbank.com<BR>
				I searched internet and replied that private bank including my snapshot and asked them to view my recorded video inside that bank.<BR>
				Next day I have received automated email that my account has been closed successfully.</FONT>
			</UL>
			<H2>2. Salary Management</H2>
			<UL>
				<LI>Assume your first month salary is <STRONG>₹21,000.00 </STRONG>.</LI>
				<LI>Inform others that you are receiving <STRONG>₹12,000.00 </STRONG>.</LI>
				<LI>Transfer <STRONG>5,000.00 ₹/INR</STRONG> from your bank (using NEFT without using IMPS) to your Post Office account Internet banking.</LI>
			</UL>
			<H2>3. Monthly Deposits</H2>
			<UL>
				<LI>After receiving your salary, transfer the last month last balance from your salary account to your Post Office account using NEFT without using IMPS.</LI>
			</UL>
			<H2>4. Opening MIS</H2>
			<UL>
				<LI>Whenever your saved amount at post-office reaches <STRONG>5,000.00 ₹/INR</STRONG>, open a MIS (Monthly Income Scheme) account at the Post Office using internet banking without travelling and wasting petrol/diesel.</LI>
				<LI>Open MIS sequentially on different days (1st, 2nd, 3rd … 31st) of different months or years.</LI>
				<LI>Example: 01-Jan-2026, 02-Mar-2026, 03-Jun-2026, …</LI>
			<LI>Reason for using 5,000.00:<BR>
			a) This principal used to give 31.00 interest during 10 months and 30.00 during 2 months.<BR>
			Like the same we receive interest every month for 5 years.<BR>
			After five years, re-deposit your (original post office MIS) principal to MIS again.<BR>
			However after five years, use principal based on current MIS interest at post office. Like: 5000.00 if MIS interest is 7.4%...
		</UL>
		<H2>5. MIS Interest</H2>
		<UL>
			<LI>Since each month has 4 or 5 Sundays, MIS interest (₹31.00 or 30.00) will be credited to your post office savings account on Saturdays instead of Sundays.</LI>
			<LI>Assume that christmas/ramzan/Deepavali/... public holidays came on Monday.<BR>
			MIS interest on monday will be received on sunday.<BR>
			Due to sunday we will receive interest on Saturday.
			<LI>Save MIS interest in Post Office itself.</LI>
			<LI>Once the saved amount reaches 5,000.00 ₹/INR again, open a new MIS using Internet banking without physically visiting the post office, saving fuel and reducing pollution.</LI>
